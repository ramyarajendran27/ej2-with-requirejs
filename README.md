# EJ2 with RequireJS

This project serves as a comprehensive example demonstrating the integration and usage of Syncfusion Essential JS 2 (EJ2) UI controls within a RequireJS environment. RequireJS is a JavaScript file and module loader that helps manage dependencies efficiently in modular web applications. By combining EJ2's powerful UI components with RequireJS's modular loading system, this setup provides a scalable and maintainable approach to building interactive web interfaces.

Essential JS 2 is a comprehensive UI library that offers over 140+ high-performance, lightweight components for building modern web applications. These components include grids, charts, inputs, buttons, and much more, all designed with modern web standards in mind. Using RequireJS with EJ2 allows for lazy loading of modules, improving application performance by loading only the necessary components when needed.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started with this project, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- **Node.js**: Version 14.0 or higher is required. You can download it from the official Node.js website (nodejs.org). Node.js provides the runtime environment for executing JavaScript outside the browser and includes npm, the package manager used for installing dependencies.

- **npm**: Version 6.0 or higher, which comes bundled with Node.js. npm will be used to install project dependencies as defined in the package.json file.

- **Text Editor or IDE**: A code editor such as Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or any preferred IDE that supports JavaScript and TypeScript development.

- **Web Browser**: A modern web browser like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Microsoft Edge for testing and viewing the application.

- **Git**: Optional, but recommended for version control. You can install it from git-scm.com.

## Installation

To set up and run this project locally, follow these installation steps:

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**: If you haven't already, obtain the project files either by cloning this repository using Git (`git clone <repository-url>`).

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Open your terminal or command prompt and change to the project directory:
   ```
   cd ej2-with-requirejs
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: Use npm to install all required dependencies. Run the following command:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
   This command reads the package.json file and downloads all the necessary packages, including EJ2 components, RequireJS, and other development tools.

## Configuration

### RequireJS Setup

The require.config.js file contains the configuration for RequireJS, defining paths to EJ2 modules and other dependencies. This setup enables efficient module loading:

```javascript
require.config({
    paths: {
        // EJ2 component paths
        'ej/base': './node_modules/@syncfusion/ej2-base/dist/ej2-base.min',
        'ej/buttons': './node_modules/@syncfusion/ej2-buttons/dist/ej2-buttons.min',
        // ... other EJ2 modules
    }
});
```

## Running the Application

To start the application:

1. **Start a Local Server**: Since this is a client-side application using RequireJS, you may need a local web server. You can use Node.js's built-in module or a simple server package:
   ```
   npx http-server
   ```
   This will start a server at http://localhost:8080 (default port).

2. **Open in Browser**: Navigate to `http://localhost:8080/index.html` in your web browser to view the application.

3. **Development Server (if configured)**: If the project includes a build process, check the package.json for available scripts like `npm run dev` or `npm run build`.
